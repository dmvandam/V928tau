# Period Folding

We binned all the photometric data and ran it through a period folding grid with step size 0.002 days. For each binsize and acceptable sigma a folder contains all the plots where all the data within the <strong>K2</strong> eclipse is within x sigma (where sigma is the error on that data point) of the interpolated <strong>K2</strong> eclipse. We only produce plots if 90% of the data meets this requirement.

Due to size constraints on GitHub, the data has not been uploaded, but it can be requested by e-mail.
