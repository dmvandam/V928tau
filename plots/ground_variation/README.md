# Ground Variations

This folder contains all the plots to determine whether or not the stellar variation model (from the corresponding notebook) applies for the full baseline of observations we have.
We attempted several binsizes (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 days) and could not validate the model over a longer baseline.
This could be for several reasons including, but not limited to: larger errors on ground-based data; the evolution of stellar activity; long-term trends; other eclipses/flares...etc.

The folder name structure is as follows

bs=x.xx_ws=yy.y/

where bs is the binsize in days and ws is the window size i.e. one plot every yy.y days
